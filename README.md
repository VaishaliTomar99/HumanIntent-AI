# 🧠 HumanIntent-AI

A deep learning-based project focused on detecting human intention and violence using sequential video data.

---

## 📌 Description
This project uses a CNN-LSTM architecture to analyze video frames and identify violent or non-violent behavior. The model learns spatial features from frames and temporal patterns across sequences.

---

## ✨ Features
- Human intention and violence detection
- Sequence-based video analysis
- Deep learning model (CNN + LSTM)
- Modular and organized code structure

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Streamlit (for visualization)
- Matplotlib

---

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run src/intent_dashboard.py
